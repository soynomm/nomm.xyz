I'm a passionate tinkerer who got into software development not for a job, but 
for scratching that curiosity itch. I also really just like building stuff. The
job stuff just naturally followed. Now while I have plenty more projects on my
[Github page](https://github.com/soynomm), this here is a list of the ones actively maintained & used by me.

## [Bloggo](https://github.com/soynomm/bloggo)

A blog-oriented static site generator used for this very site, written in 
Python. I wrote this to learn Python and to, naturally, have a tailor-made blog 
machine that tickles my fancy. 

## [Splendid Speed](#)

A WordPress performance plugin I made pretty much out of frustration that any 
existing plugin was full of bloat, ads or who-knows-what. It has a total of 12
modules to speed up your WordPress powered site, entirely free, no strings attached.
