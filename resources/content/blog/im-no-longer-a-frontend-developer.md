[True to my word](/blog/i-dont-want-to-do-frontend-anymore/), as of today I'm no longer a front-end developer. Yesterday
marked the last day as one, and also the last day at [GPM](https://www.greenpowermonitor.com/), 
where I had spent my last 2 and a half years. The first two years I spent almost entirely
writing ClojureScript, which I must say is a joy to write, and the rest writing TypeScript, 
which to me is, like my colleagues know, a poor man's typed language.

**Funny story about GPM:** I was new in Barcelona and needed a job, so I applied to a 
few JavaScript positions, one of which was GPM. I had just one call with them 
after which I received a formal offer. Once arriving to the offices to sign my 
contract I found out that I will be doing ClojureScript instead, which if you don't know 
is about as different from JavaScript as a thing could be. I also found out that 
they had forgotten to send me a test job and that it was obviously a bit late for that. 
Seems all worked out however.

I have no bad words about the company, or the people I've worked with. In fact, I 
was told that if I ever find myself in Barcelona again and would like to work for
them again, the door is always open - and while it would certainly have to be 
back-end for me then - I really wouldn't mind. I've met amazing people there and 
will not miss a chance to invite them for a drink whenever I find myself in 
Spain again. 

So what's next for me? Well, if you read my post [on creating a static site generator](/blog/creating-a-static-site-generator-in-python/), 
you'd probably guess it was Python, and you'd guess right. I've done enough of 
job market, developer happiness and would-i-like-it research to be able to guess
with a pretty high probability that I'd be happy writing Python. I mean I of course
won't know for sure until I've spent a considerable amount of time writing it, and there
are other factors such as general back-end tooling, but the feeling is there.

I'm sure that the transition to back-end won't be an easy one as there are a lot of tools 
and technologies I need to catch up with, as well as brush up on my algo's and data
structures. Believe it or not in my 10 years as an engineer, never really needed 
too much of that. That said, I'm determined to become a back-end expert, and par for the course, 
expert in data structures and algo's as well. After all, I've heard that it's 
impossible to land a back-end job without knowing how to revert different types of trees.

I know some of you might cringe reading this and think I must not be so bright, 
and perhaps you are right, but I managed to learn all of this on my own with no
mentors and no formal education, just a bunch of googling and of building a ton of 
side projects, and I've done well for myself thus far, and 
that's the only measure of success that matters to me. Way I see the world, 
it's the only measure of success that should matter to anyone. 

Here's to the next 10 years of software development!
